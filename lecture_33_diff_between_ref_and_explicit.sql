Same as we know already

There are two types of cursor:
    Strongly typed
    weakly typed
    
So far, we have studied is weakly typed. It means there is no return type (data type) we expect. It can return whatever it wants
On other other hand, in Strongly typed cursors, we mention the return types.
    So if there is any other values are returned, it gives error
    
Also point to note is that when we mention ttype, like rowtype or record etc. it doesnt need to be same table returned, It just need to match whole row
of same data type
