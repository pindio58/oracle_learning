Triggers 

This is all about documentation of what we have learnt so far

What is trigger?
    *   Trigger, as name suggests, is like a push to do something on some event. For e.g. pinching on hand pushes brain to pull off
    *   This can be implemented on table, views, system/server, database

Types based on "sequence":
            BEFORE
            UPDATE

Types based on events:

        1) DML
                Insert
                Update
                Delete
                
        2) DDL
                Alter
                Drop
                Add
                truncate
                grant
                invoke
            
        3) Instead of 
                This is implemented on views
            
        4) system level
                On system level. Like restarting, starting, shutting down server
                
        5) compound triggers
                when we can implement many triggers on one place
        
 
 Types based on statemnets
 
        1) Row level statement
                which iterartes through each row
        2) Statement level
                which doesn't
